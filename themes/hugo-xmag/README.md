# HUGO XMAG

**XMag** is designed based on the Hugo theme [**XMin**](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin), and similarly, features minimalism but with a magazine style on the homepage inspired by [The Signpost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost) on Wikipedia.

This theme includes a few cool features:

- Responsive article summary blocks on homepage

- Thumbnails in summary blocks

- Magazine title in Blackletter (&Bfr;&Lfr;&Afr;&Cfr;&Kfr; &Lfr;&Efr;&Tfr;&Tfr;&Efr;&Rfr;)

- Github edit links

- Author info and site info at the bottom of an article

- MathJax for LaTeX math expressions

It also supports features that are probably not even worth mentioning:

- Google Analytics

- highlight.js for syntax highlighting of code blocks

- Display categories and tags on single pages

- Table of contents for single pages

Most features can be configured through `config.toml`, and a few can be enabled by custom layouts. Please see the detailed documentation on the [About](https://xmag.yihui.name/about/) page of the theme website. The source code is available [on Github](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmag) (MIT license).
