This text analysis is part of my abstract (co-authored with [Rodrigo Werle](https://twitter.com/WiscWeeds) and Sarah [Marinho](https://twitter.com/SarahMarinho20)) presented at the North Central Weed Science Society (**NCWSS**) meeting that was held remotely in December 2020. Here I am presenting part of that abstract, the **weed species** ranked among top 100 words from 2001 through 2020. I am adding to this analysis the 2020 meeting proceedings. Also, I am running the text analysis with much less coding that I have done for the **NCWSS** meeting. That is what I am going to show in this analysis. If you just want to see the figure, please scroll to the bottom of this page.

First we have to load the packages needed for this analysis. Please run the codes below: 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(textreadr)
library(pdftools)
library(ggtext)
# if you do not have any of these packages installed, please run install.packages("name_of_the_package")
```

I have downloaded all **NCWSS** proceedings and added into a folder named docs (name of your choice). You can find all PDFs in "code" below the post title (folder docs). 

I used the *str_c* function to get all PDFs, which is into the folder "docs". The pdfs output contains the path for all 20 **NCWSS** proceedings.

```{r name-pdfs}
pdfs <- str_c("docs", "/", list.files("docs", pattern = "*.pdf"), 
              sep = "")
pdfs 
```

Next you will named all these pdfs. If you run the code below, *list.files* will keep the PDFs names as shown in the code above. 

```{r}
pdf_names <- list.files("docs", pattern = "*.pdf")
pdf_names
```

Here is where the magic occurs, I will use the function *map* of the package **purrr** (tidyverse core). Using *map* function sames a lot of coding and time.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2YWs1NexTst9YmFG/giphy.gif)

```{r}
pdfs_text <- map(pdfs, pdftools::pdf_text)
```

This "magic" is called iteration, so instead of running the analysis by each year we can run it all together. Running *pdfs_text* alone you get you all proceedings organized as a list. I am not running *pdfs_text* here because it is a large output. Nonetheless, *pdfs_text* is not tidy for the analysis yet.

The iteration with *map* function should be proceeded with a *tibble* function to organize the proceedings by each year.

```{r}
pdf <- tibble(document = pdf_names, text = pdfs_text) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2001:2020) # adding a column for each year
pdf
```
As you can see in the tibble (data frame) above, each proceeding is stored as a list by each year (e.g., <chr [248]>). 

Now that we have a tidy tibble, we can proceed with the [tokenization](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html) using the function *unnest_tokens*.


```{r unnest-tokens}
pdf1 <- pdf %>% 
  unnest(text) %>% # pdfs_text is a list
  mutate(text = str_to_lower(text), # making all text lower case
         text = str_replace(text, "2,4-d", 
                            "twofourd"), # need to replace it
         text = str_replace(text, "marestail", 
                            "horseweed")) %>% # marestail = horseweed
  unnest_tokens(word, text, strip_numeric = TRUE)

pdf1 %>% 
  slice_head(n = 10)
```

You have notice that I used *mutate* function to change 2,4-D to "twofourd" because tokenization would split it in 2, 4 and D. Also because of their dual names, I have made marestail = horseweed. 

Next we need to remove the "stopwords". Stopwords are words like "in", "and", "at", "their", "about" etc. The function *get_stopwords* from tidytext package has five "stopword" sources, I will add them all and stored in *stopwords*. See below:

```{r stopwords}
stopwords <- get_stopwords("en", source = c("smart")) %>% 
  bind_rows(get_stopwords("en", source = c("marimo"))) %>% 
  bind_rows(get_stopwords("en", source = c("nltk"))) %>% 
  bind_rows(get_stopwords("en", source = c("stopwords-iso"))) %>% 
  bind_rows(get_stopwords("en", source = c("snowball")))

stopwords %>% 
  slice_head(n=10)
```

Now that I have a tibble called "stopwords", I will use *anti_join* function to remove the **stopwords** from **pdf1**

```{r stopwords-1}
pdf2 <- pdf1 %>%
  anti_join(stopwords, by = "word")
```


The *get_stopwords* function with all sources attributes is not enough to remove all words needed for my goal in this analysis. For example, I do not want to have words like "virtual", "kansas", "werle", "proceedings" etc. I have manually made a random "stopwords" for weed science meetings, please check the [WSSA text analysis](https://www.openweedsci.org/post/2020/02/25/2020-wssa/wsws-meeting-program-text-analysis/). I am bringing a "stopword" that I made in my previous analysis in a source code "stop_words.R". You can find "stop_words.R" in the "code" below the post title.

```{r}
source("stop_words.R")
```

I have saved it as **stop_tibble**, which is used also with *anti_join* function. The *anti_join* function as described above will remove all "stopwords" in **stop_tibble** from **pdf2**. Notice that here I am also using mutate to bring back 2,4-D. 

```{r cleaning}
pdf3 <- pdf2 %>% 
  anti_join(stop_tibble, by = c("word")) %>% # stop_tibble is in the source code
  mutate(word = str_replace(word, "twofourd", "2,4-d")) # bring back 2,4-d
```

Next I will use functions to *count* words over the years, *arrange* it as descending, *group_by* year, rank top 100 words (*row_number*) and *filter* the top 100 words by each year. 

```{r}
pdf4 <- pdf3 %>% 
  count(year, word) %>% 
  arrange(year, -n) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  mutate(rank = row_number()) %>% 
  filter(rank <= 100)
```

Now I have the top 100 words by each year:

```{r}
pdf4 %>% 
  slice_head(n = 10)
```

In this analysis I am interested only on weeds present in the top 100 words in 2001 and 2020. Therefore, I am using *if_else* function to create new columns for highlighting selected weed species. You can change and select any word if want as I did it with herbicides in my poster at the 2020 **NCWSS** meeting.

```{r}
pdf5 <- pdf4 %>% 
  mutate(highlight = if_else(word %in% c("amaranth", "palmer", 
                                         "kochia", "horseweed", 
                                         "grass", "nightshade", 
                                         "waterhemp", "velvetleaf", 
                                         "ragweed", "sunflower",
                                         "foxtail"), TRUE, FALSE),
       variable_col = if_else(highlight == TRUE, word, "NA"))

pdf5 %>% 
  slice_head(n = 5)
```


Now the tibble is ready. Then, I will proceed with data visualization. First I will set the font family, colors and theme. 


```{r}
#Set theme
library(extrafont)
extrafont::loadfonts()
font_family <- 'Helvetica'
title_family <- ".New York"
background <- "#1D1D1D"
text_colour <- "white"
axis_colour <- "white"
plot_colour <- "black"
theme_style <- theme(text = element_text(family = font_family),
                  rect = element_rect(fill = background),
                  plot.background = element_rect(fill = background, color = NA),
                  plot.title = element_markdown(family = title_family,
                                            face = 'bold', size = 80, colour = text_colour),
                  plot.subtitle = element_markdown(family = title_family, 
                                                   size = 40, colour = text_colour),
                  plot.caption = element_markdown(family = title_family,
                                              size = 25, colour = text_colour, hjust = 0),
                  panel.background = element_rect(fill = background, color = NA),
                  panel.border = element_blank(),
                  panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
                  panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
                  panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
                  plot.margin = unit(c(3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), "cm"), # top, left, bottom, right
                  axis.title.y = element_text(face = 'bold', size = 40, 
                                              colour = text_colour),
                  axis.title.x = element_blank(),
                  axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(size = 45, colour= axis_colour, 
                                                    vjust = 17),
                  axis.text.x.top = element_text(size = 45, colour= axis_colour, 
                                                    vjust = -14),
                  axis.text.y = element_text(size = 30, colour = text_colour),
                  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
                  axis.line = element_blank(),
                  legend.text = element_text(size = 20, colour= text_colour),
                  legend.title = element_text(size = 25, colour= text_colour),
                  legend.position="none") 


theme_set(theme_classic() + theme_style)

#Set colour palette
cols <- c("#F2D9F3", "#F2D9F3", "#00E5E5", "#DEB887", 
          "#FAC8C8", "#39393A", "#FA9664", 
          "#FF4040", "#48DE7A", "#942DC7", 
          "#F5F5DC", "#FAFA00")
```


Then I will plot the data. The idea here is to see the difference between weeds from top 100 words in 2001 and 2020.


```{r}
figure <- pdf5 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = rank, group = word)) +
  geom_line(data = pdf5 %>% filter(variable_col == "NA"),
                                      color = "#39393A", size = 4) +
  geom_point(data = pdf5 %>% filter(variable_col == "NA"),
                                      color = "#39393A", size = 10) +
  geom_line(data = pdf5 %>% filter(variable_col != "NA"),
                                       aes(color = variable_col), size = 4) +
  geom_point(data = pdf5 %>% filter(variable_col != "NA"),
                                       aes(color = variable_col), size = 10) +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks = 100:1, sec.axis = dup_axis()) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2001, 2020, 2), limits= c(1999.8, 2021.2), 
                     expand = c(.05, .05), sec.axis = dup_axis()) +
  geom_text(data = pdf5 %>% filter(year == "2001"),
            aes(label = word, x = 2000.8, color = variable_col),
            hjust = "right",
            fontface = "bold",
            size = 11) +
  geom_text(data = pdf5 %>%  filter(year == "2020"),
            aes(label = word, x = 2020.2, color = variable_col),
            hjust = "left",
            fontface = "bold",
            size = 11) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(101,1)) +
   scale_color_manual(values = cols) +
  labs(title = "<b style='color:red;'>NCWSS</b> annual meeting 
       proceedinds text analysis from 2001 through 2020",
       subtitle = "Figure shows the rank of top 100 words of 2001 (left)

       y= "Rank",
       caption = "Visualization: @maxwelco adapted from @JaredBraggins | Source: NCWSS") 


#Export plot 
ggsave("top_weeds.png", width = 40, height = 60, dpi=400, limitsize = FALSE, figure)
```


Check the figure carefully. What were you doing in 2001? What do you think have changed across 20 years? What is the same? Make your own conclusions.
