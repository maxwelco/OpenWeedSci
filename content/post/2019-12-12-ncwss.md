## Symposia

A RStudio symposia was conducted at the 74th North Central Weed Science Society (NCWSS) Meeting in Columbus, OH on December 11, 2019. Thanks to [Ethann Barnes](https://twitter.com/EthannBarnes) for putting together the RStudio symposia and NCWSS committee members for accepting our proposal.

# Attendees

There were a mix of faculty, students and industry personnel attending the Rstudio symposia. The attendees were of different skill levels in R; thus, the workshop covered from the basics to the advanced levels. Three important topics of weed research were presented, including weed population modeling, critical time for weed control, and dose-response studies. In addition, it was demonstrated the power of RStudio to produce high quality documents and manuscripts for publications in scientific journals. The feedback was positive and we are looking forward to contribute with the NCWSS again.

- [x] Data manipulation with tidyverse package
- [x] Dose-response and Critical Time for Weed Control with *drc* package
