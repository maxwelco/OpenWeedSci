<h2>Web scraping</h2>
<p>Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web pages use HyperText Markup Language (<strong>HTML</strong>). HTML isn’t a programming language like R. However, it’s a markup language with its own syntax and rules. In addition, Cascading Style Sheets, or <strong>CSS</strong>, is a language for adding styles to HTML pages.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/web-scraping-using-python.png" /></p>
<p>This post will lead you to get an structured data of herbicide weed resistance by country from the <a href="http://weedscience.org/Home.aspx" class="uri">http://weedscience.org/Home.aspx</a> website. I am not gonna teach you about the full details of web scaping. Rather using web scraping techniques in R to get herbicide resistance data.</p>
</div>
<div id="herbicide-resistance" class="section level2">
<h2>Herbicide resistance</h2>
<p>It is not novel that herbicide resistance is a major problem worldwide. If you are a student, Professor, extension or industry personnel in the field of Weed Science, you have probably landed in the <strong>The International Herbicide-Resistant Weed Database</strong> (<a href="http://weedscience.org/Home.aspx" class="uri">http://weedscience.org/Home.aspx</a>), which is leaded by Dr. Ian Heap. If you are a novice in Weed Science, here is the website description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds is a collaborative effort between weed scientists in over 80 countries. Our main aim is to maintain scientific accuracy in the reporting of herbicide resistant weeds globally. This collaborative effort is supported by government, academic, and industry weed scientists worldwide. This project is funded by the Global Herbicide Resistance Action Committee and CropLife International.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://weedscience.org/Home.aspx">website</a> is the best resource for retrieving herbicide weed resistance data. There are many ways you can get data from this herbicide resistance database. One common method is to copy and paste data from the region or weed of iquiry into a spreadsheet or a text file to summarize. However, as you know, we are vested in making your life easier when it comes to weed science data analysis. So in this post Max will show you how to extract the data and direct it into R.</p>
</div>
<div id="packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>For this exercise the main packages used are <strong>rvest</strong> for scraping websites and <strong>tidyverse</strong> for data manipulation. Let’s start by running the codes below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install.packages(&quot;rvest&quot;) #Remove # if you need to install these packages
#install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="scraping-herbicide-resistance-weeds-by-county-and-site-of-action" class="section level2">
<h2>Scraping herbicide resistance weeds by county and site of action</h2>
<p>Once you have loaded the package in R we will start retrieving the herbicide resistance weeds by county and site of action. The data needed can be found here: <a href="http://weedscience.org/Summary/CountrySummary.aspx" class="uri">http://weedscience.org/Summary/CountrySummary.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the web page with red lines representing 20 rows of the dataset we need to retrieve from this page. You can see that there are a list of 71 countries.</p>
<p><img src="resistance.png" /></p>
<p>Now we need to load the web page (<a href="http://weedscience.org/Summary/CountrySummary.aspx" class="uri">http://weedscience.org/Summary/CountrySummary.aspx</a>) in R. We will use the function <em>read_html</em>. Now let’s run the code below. Notice that “world_resistance” is the name I chose to assign the webpage information.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>world_resistance &lt;- read_html(&quot;http://weedscience.org/Summary/CountrySummary.aspx&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The webpage link is now stored in “world_resistance”. We will now use two functions, <em>html_node</em> and <em>html_table</em>, to extract only the Herbicide Resistance Weeds by County and Site of Action Table. The <em>html_node()</em> extract the <strong>selector</strong>, which is “table” for this webpage. Then I use <em>html_table()</em> to make the output as a table. Notice the operator <em>%&gt;%</em> is used to pass the result of one step as input for the next step.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>resistance_chart &lt;- world_resistance %&gt;% 
    html_node(&quot;table&quot;) %&gt;% 
    html_table(fill = TRUE)

resistance_chart %&gt;% 
  slice_head(n = 5) # display 5 rows </code></pre>

<p>Notice that the output of “resistance_chart” is not tidy yet (and you know we like our data tidy, don’t we!?). We will use package <strong>janitor</strong> functions <em>row_to_names()</em> and <em>clean_names()</em> to adjust the table header.</p>

<h2>Scraping herbicide resistant weeds with detail information</h2>
<p>You might be interested in selecting herbicide resistant weeds data in a country of your choice. Here we will show how to extract herbicide resistance data from all 71 countries listed in the Heap et al. database. The gif below demonstrates the data that we are retrieving from the website.</p>
<p><img src="scrape.gif" /></p>
<p>I clicked on United States to show the data that we are retrieving from the website but we will get that data from all 71 countries listed here: <a href="http://weedscience.org/Summary/Country.aspx" class="uri">http://weedscience.org/Summary/Country.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>The figure below show an example of the data we are are interested. Notice the website link changed a bit when we click on United States: <a href="http://weedscience.org/Summary/Country.aspx?CountryID=45" class="uri">http://weedscience.org/Summary/Country.aspx?CountryID=45</a>. If you look closely, the only thing is changing is the last attribute of the link, ID. Each country has their own code ID. The United States ID is 45.</p>
<p><img src="usa.png" />
Knowing that we can extract all 71 countries’ data at once. We will use a similar code snippet, as demonstrated earlier in this post. The difference is that we are using the codes inside a function (<em>country_function</em>) that takes the country id as an argument and pass into the function body.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>country_function &lt;- function(id) {
  
  url &lt;- paste0(&quot;http://weedscience.org/Summary/Country.aspx?CountryID=&quot;,id,&quot;&quot;)
  #id will change by each country id number
  
  resistance &lt;- read_html(url)

  chart &lt;- resistance %&gt;% 
    html_node(&quot;.rgMasterTable&quot;) %&gt;% # selector
    html_table(fill = TRUE) # get the table

  chart %&gt;% 
    slice_head(n = 5) # get first 5 rows 

  final_chart &lt;- chart %&gt;% 
    janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 2) %&gt;% # make second column header
    janitor::clean_names() %&gt;% # clean header
    as_tibble() %&gt;% # tibble is better than data.frame
    drop_na() %&gt;% # drop NA values
    mutate_at(c(&quot;number&quot;, &quot;first_year&quot;, 
                &quot;country_id&quot;, &quot;resist_id&quot;), 
              as.integer) # make columns numbers as integer 
  # Get final dataset
  final_chart 
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, the function is done and we want to test it. Lets use id = 1 to see the output.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>country_function(id = 1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 152 x 10

<p>Great! The function works. It gets the data from Australia, which means that the Australia ID in this website is 1. However, countries are listed alphabetically here: <a href="http://weedscience.org/Summary/CountrySummary.aspx" class="uri">http://weedscience.org/Summary/CountrySummary.aspx</a>. Therefore, I was expecting Argentina to be id = 1, not Australia.</p>
<p>It turns out that id number is not following the alphabetical order.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5YoGUlh5VZGlquMzl1/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>Fear not, we’ve got a plan.</p>
<p>After some workarounds I have gotten the full country name and id number.</p>

<p>Once you have the data set with country and id number, we can iterate with <em>map</em> function from <strong>purrr</strong> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>resistance_data &lt;- country %&gt;%

  mutate(resistance_data = map(id, country_function)) # iterate function over id
# resistance data is in a list by each country

<p>The “final_resistance_data” contains the full resistance dataset of all 71 countries listed in Heap et al. There are many possibilities when working with this data, you can filter by your country or use visualization. Its up to you!</p>
<p>If you want to filter by country:</p>
<pre><code>final_resistance_data %&gt;% 
  filter(country_name == &quot;name of the country&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We would like to thank Heap at al. for providing this great herbicide resistance database and all of the weed scientist collaborators that submit data for reporting.</p>
