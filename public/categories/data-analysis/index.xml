      <description>Background Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that generates multiple decision trees using a subsample of bootstrapped observations from randomly selected explanatory variables. Random Forest is a useful tool for variable selection in large and complex datasets for quantitative, discrete, and qualitative variables and has been utilized for response variables such as Amaranthus spp. resistance (Vieira et al. 2018 and Oliveira et al. 2020), weed biomass in cover crops (Baraibar et al.</description>

      <description>Background Assessments of visual weed control in response to herbicide treatments is likely the most common experiment and data analysis conducted within the Weed Science discipline. The goal of these experiments is to investigate herbicides that promote the best level of control of targeted weed species. These experiments are usually organized in a one-way randomized complete block design with multiple treatments (herbicides). At a pre-established number of days after treatment (DAT; researcher choice), a percent (%) visual control rate is given to each targeted weed.</description>

      <title>Crop-weed competition in additive design</title>

      <description>Background Crop–weed competition is extensively studied in weed science. The additive design, in which weed density varies and the crop density is kept constant, is the most commonly utilized design in plant competition studies. The additive design is important to calculate economic weed thresholds and improve weed control decision-making.
