      <description>This text analysis is part of my poster (co-authored with Rodrigo Werle and Sarah Marinho) presented at the 2020 Virtual North Central Weed Science Society NCWSS annual meeting (December 2020). Here I am presenting part of that abstract focused on weed species ranked amongst the top 100 words from 2001 through 2020 (I am adding the 2020 meeting proceedings to this analysis). I am also running the text analysis with less coding than for the 2020 NCWSS meeting which is what I am going to show in this analysis.</description>

      <description>Conference The 2020 Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) and Western Society of Weed Science (WSWS) joint meeting will be held on Mar 2-5 in Maui (http://wssa.net/meeting/2020-annual-meeting/), Hawaii. Unfortunately, some of us will not be present at the meeting but the data analysis discussed herein can help you learn the main Weed Science topics to be discussed in Hawaii.
 Analysis The goal of this text analysis is to evaluate the frequency of words in the 2020 WSSA/WSWS oral and poster titles.</description>
