      <description>It is not novel that herbicide resistance is a major problem worldwide. If you are a student, Professor, extension or industry personnel in the field of Weed Science, you have probably landed in the The International Herbicide-Resistant Weed Database (http://weedscience.org/Home.aspx), which is leaded by Dr.Â Ian Heap.
